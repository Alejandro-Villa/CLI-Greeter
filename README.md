# CLI-Greeter
A little bash script that greets you with your selection of quotes

## Detailed description and use.

To use this script you need to add it to your `.bashrc` (or equivalent), it'll run every time you start your terminal and choose a random quote and display it centered on the screen.

## To-do list

* Make it so you can change the quoutes without editing the code (preferably with a plain text file next to the script).
* Make it so it doesn't split up words.
* Make it compatible with Shell (not only bash)
